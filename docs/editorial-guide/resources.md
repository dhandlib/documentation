## dh+lib Registry
In September 2014, dh+lib put out a call to crowdsource a list of websites for DH groups/centers at various academic institutions to create the [dh+lib Registry](https://acrl.ala.org/dh/registry/). This list of groups offering support for digital humanities or digital scholarship was developed in response to a sense that we all want to know what other people are doing and how they present themselves/communicate with their campus communities. 

Individuals fill out the [collaborative spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13hZlUCp3Zc5l7vAJyxfpcyIL8lnb4sZhtvW7MzQlHNo/edit#gid=0) with basic information (institution, name of group/center, url, boilerplate description). An editor is automatically notified of changes to the spreadsheet and creates a new link on the dh+lib Registry page. The [Link View plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/link-view/) allows us to display notes beneath each link using WordPressâ€™s blogroll feature. 

Updates to the Registry are made weekly.
